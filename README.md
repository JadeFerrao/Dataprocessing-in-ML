# Dataprocessing in ML

**Data standardisation**: Scaling features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 for improved model performance.  
**Handling missing values**: Managing and filling in or removing incomplete data points to prevent model errors.  
**Label encoding**: Converting categorical labels into numerical values for machine learning algorithms.  
**Train, test & split data**: Dividing a dataset into training and testing subsets to assess model performance.  
**Handling imbalanced dataset**: Techniques to address unequal class distribution in a dataset, such as resampling or using specialized algorithms.  
**Feature extraction of text using TF-IDF**: Transforming text data into numerical features based on term frequency and inverse document frequency.  
**Numerical dataset preprocessing**: Preparing numerical data for modeling through tasks like scaling, normalization, or outlier treatment.  
**Text dataset preprocessing**: Cleaning and tokenizing text data, removing stop words, and vectorizing for machine learning analysis.
